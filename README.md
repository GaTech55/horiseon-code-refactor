## Description

The Horiseon website is a website that provides information on Search Engine Optimization, Oline Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. The website also covers Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management. The purpose of this project was to refactor the website so that it follows accessibility standards and that it is optimized for search engines. Throughout this project I've learned morea bout adding Alt tags to images, adding semantic elements to HTML and consolidating CSS selectors. The greatest challenge was faced during the consolidation of CSS selectors.
